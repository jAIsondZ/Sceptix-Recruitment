		<p>FOSS is software that is released under a license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. This means that anyone can access the source code of the software, study it, modify it, and share it with others.</p>
		<p>Some examples of popular FOSS include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the Firefox web browser, and the LibreOffice productivity suite.</p>

            <h1>A Brief History</h1>
            <div class="content3">
                <h2>Origin of FOSS</h2>
                <p>The origins of FOSS go back to the 1950s. When the hardware was purchased, there used to be no additional charges for bundled software and the source code would also be available in order to fix possible bugs in the software. It was actually a common practice back then for users with the freedom to customize the code.At that time, primarily academicians and researchers in the industry were the collaborators to develop such software.
                    The term Open Source was not there yet. Instead, the term that was popular at that time was “Public Domain Software”. As of today, ideologically, both are very much different in nature even though they may sound similar.</p>
                    <p>Back in 1955, some users of the IBM 701 computer system from Los Angeles, voluntarily founded a group called SHARE. The “SHARE Program Library Agency” (SPLA) distributed information and software through magnetic tapes.
                    Technical information shared, was about programming languages, operating systems, database systems, and user experiences for enterprise users of small, medium, and large-scale IBM computers.
                    The initiative that is now more than 60 years old, continues to follow its goals quite actively. SHARE has its upcoming event coming up as SHARE Phoenix 2019. You can download and check out their complete timeline here.</p>
                    <h2>The GNU Project</h2>
                    <p>Announced at MIT on September 27, 1983, by Richard Stallman, the GNU Project is what immensely empowers and supports the Free Software Community today.</p> 
                    <h2>Free Software Foundation</h2>
                    <p>The “Free Software Movement” by Richard Stallman established a new norm for developing Free Software.
                    He founded The Free Software Foundation (FSF) on 4th October 1985 to support the free software movement. Software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software came to be called as Free Software.</p>
                    <h2>The Free Software Movement laid the following rules to establish the distinctiveness of the idea:</h2>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).</li>
                    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
                    <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).</li>
                    <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Linux Kernel</h2>
                    <p1>How can we miss this section at It’s FOSS! The Linux kernel was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. At first, it was neither Free Software nor used an Open-source software license. In February 1992, Linux was relicensed under the GPL.
                    The Linux Foundation has a goal to empower open source projects to accelerate technology development and commercial adoption. It is an initiative that was taken in 2000 via the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) which later merged with the Free Standards Group.
                    Linus Torvalds works at The Linux Foundation which provides complete support to him so that he can work full-time on improving Linux.</p1>
                    <h2>Open Source</h2>
                    <p>When the source code of Netscape Communicator was released in 1998, the label “Open Source” was adopted by a group of individuals at a strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California. The idea grew from a visionary realization that the Netscape announcement had changed the way people looked at commercial software.
                    This opened up a whole new world, creating a new perspective that revealed the superiority and advantage of an open development process that could be powered by collaboration.
                    Christine Peterson was the one among that group of individuals who originally suggested the term “Open Source” as we perceive it today (mentioned earlier).</p>
                    <h2>Evolution of Business Models</h2>
                    <p>The concept of Open Source is a huge phenomenon right now and there are several companies that continue to adopt the Open Source Approach to this day. As of April 2015, 78% of companies used Open Source Software with different Open Source License.
                    Several organizations have adopted different business models for Open Source. Red Hat and Mozilla are two good examples.</p>

            <h1>FOSS Alternative for Common Application</h1>
            <div class="content4">
                <p>FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) provides alternatives to common proprietary applications.</p>
                <p>Here are a few examples:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>LibreOffice - A popular alternative to Microsoft Office, LibreOffice provides a suite of tools for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and more. It is compatible with multiple file formats, including Microsoft Office formats.</li>
                    <li>GIMP - An image editing tool that can be used as an alternative to Adobe Photoshop. GIMP provides similar functionality and supports a wide range of file formats.</li>
                    <li>Firefox - A web browser that provides a viable alternative to Google Chrome. Firefox provides a secure and private browsing experience and is available on multiple platforms.</li>
                    <li>Audacity - A digital audio editor that can be used as an alternative to Adobe Audition. Audacity provides tools for recording, editing, and mixing audio files.</li>
                    <li>Blender - A 3D modeling and animation tool that can be used as an alternative to Autodesk Maya. Blender provides tools for modeling, rendering, and animation and supports a wide range of file formats.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These FOSS alternatives offer a viable option for individuals and organizations looking for cost-effective software solutions without compromising functionality or quality.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="expandable5">
            <h1>FOSS's ties with GNU/Linux</h1>
            <div class="content5">
                <p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has strong ties with GNU/Linux, which is a popular operating system that uses the Linux kernel. GNU is a project started in 1983 by Richard Stallman to create a complete free operating system. It includes a collection of tools and utilities that can be used to create a Unix-like environment.Linux, on the other hand, is a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 that is used in many operating systems, including GNU/Linux. GNU/Linux is a combination of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel, which together provide a complete operating system.</p>
                <p>FOSS plays a significant role in GNU/Linux, as the vast majority of software applications available for the platform are free and open source. The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a commonly used license for FOSS, and it allows developers to share and modify software while maintaining its free and open source status.The popularity of GNU/Linux is due in large part to the availability of free and open source software, which provides a cost-effective alternative to proprietary software. It also allows developers to create and distribute software without restrictions, leading to a vibrant ecosystem of software tools and utilities.Overall, FOSS and GNU/Linux have a close relationship, with free and open source software being a core component of the GNU/Linux ecosystem. This has led to the development of a robust and sustainable platform that continues to evolve and innovate.</p>
